# Hendrik's Tea Management System

Hendrik's Tea Factory Management System, a comprehensive web-based application that is 
transforming the management and production of tea. Its seamless integration and user friendly features enable producers to increase sales, manage payments, organize deliveries, 
supervise employees, keep an eye on inventories, and optimize supply chain operations.

## Our Web Application

The sales module of the system is primarily responsible for managing client contacts, 
tracking orders, and providing analytical insights to support strategic decision-making. The 
finance module manages spending, produces reports, and uses automated accounting and 
invoicing to provide financial transparency.
The delivery module simplifies logistics for effective shipment tracking and route 
optimization, while the payment module facilitates safe transactions through a variety of 
gateways. Workforce management is made easier by the staff module, while procurement 
procedures and stock levels are kept at ideal levels by the supply and inventory departments.
